# üñºÔ∏è Profile & Cover Photo Cleanup

## ‚úÖ Your Question: "Does changing profile/cover image delete the old one automatically?"

**YES!** Old images are automatically deleted when you upload new ones.

## üîÑ What Happens When You Change Profile/Cover Photo

### Step-by-Step Process:

```
1. User uploads new photo
   ‚Üì
2. System checks if old photo exists
   ‚Üì
3. Deletes old photo from storage (S3 or Firebase)
   ‚Üì
4. Uploads new photo to AWS S3
   ‚Üì
5. Updates database with new photo URL
   ‚Üì
6. Invalidates CloudFront cache (if stored in S3)
   ‚Üì
7. Old photo completely removed!
```

## üìç Code Locations

### Profile Photos:
- **File:** `src/app/settings/components/AccountSettings.tsx`
- **Lines:** 124-149 (Delete old photo logic)

```typescript
// Delete old profile photo if exists
const currentPhotoUrl = profile?.photoURL;
if (currentPhotoUrl) {
  if (currentPhotoUrl.includes('cloudfront.net')) {
    // Delete from AWS S3
    const { deleteFromS3, extractS3KeyFromUrl } = 
      await import('@/lib/aws/s3');
    const s3Key = extractS3KeyFromUrl(currentPhotoUrl);
    if (s3Key) {
      await deleteFromS3(s3Key); // ‚úÖ Now invalidates CloudFront!
    }
  }
}
```

### Cover Photos:
- **File:** `src/components/profile/CoverPhoto.tsx`
- **Lines:** 203-224 (Delete old cover photo logic)

```typescript
// Delete old cover photo if exists
if (currentPhotoUrl.includes('cloudfront.net')) {
  const { deleteFromS3, extractS3KeyFromUrl } = 
    await import('@/lib/aws/s3');
  const s3Key = extractS3KeyFromUrl(currentPhotoUrl);
  if (s3Key) {
    await deleteFromS3(s3Key); // ‚úÖ Now invalidates CloudFront!
  }
}
```

## ‚ú® What I Just Fixed

### Before:
- ‚ùå Old photos deleted from S3
- ‚ùå CloudFront cache NOT invalidated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Old photos still accessible via CDN for up to 1 year

### After:
- ‚úÖ Old photos deleted from S3
- ‚úÖ **CloudFront cache automatically invalidated**
- ‚úÖ Old photos immediately unavailable

### Files Updated:
1. **`src/app/api/upload/delete/route.ts`** - Added CloudFront invalidation
2. **`src/app/api/delete-media/route.ts`** - Added CloudFront invalidation

Both endpoints now invalidate CloudFront cache automatically!

---

## üß™ Testing

To verify it works:

1. **Upload a new profile photo**
2. **Wait 2-5 minutes** (for CloudFront invalidation)
3. **Try to access the old photo URL** - should get 404
4. **Check AWS S3 console** - old file should be gone

---

## üìù Important Notes

### Storage Types Supported:
- ‚úÖ **AWS S3** - Full cleanup with CloudFront invalidation
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Storage** - Cleanup without CloudFront (not needed)

### Error Handling:
- If deletion fails, the upload continues anyway
- Errors are logged but don't block new photo upload
- Prevents orphaned photos from stopping functionality

---

## üéØ Summary

**YES, old photos are automatically deleted!** 

And now, thanks to the recent update, the CloudFront cache is also invalidated automatically, so old photos become completely inaccessible immediately after you upload a new one.

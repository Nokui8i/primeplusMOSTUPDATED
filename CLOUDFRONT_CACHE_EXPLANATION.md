# üé¨ Why Videos Still Play After Deleting from AWS

## The Problem Explained

When you delete files from AWS S3, the **videos/images still work** on your website because of **CloudFront CDN caching**.

### How It Works:

```
1. Upload Video ‚Üí S3 Storage
                    ‚Üì
2. CloudFront CDN caches the video
                    ‚Üì
3. Users watch video from CloudFront cache (not S3)
                    ‚Üì
4. You delete from S3 ‚ùå
                    ‚Üì
5. CloudFront STILL has cached copy ‚ö†Ô∏è
                    ‚Üì
6. Video continues playing from cache for UP TO 1 YEAR! üìπ
```

### Your Current Configuration:

From `cloudfront-config.json`:
- **Max Cache Time:** 1 YEAR (31,536,000 seconds)
- **Cache Policy:** `managed-caching-optimized` (aggressive caching)
- **Cache-Control Header:** `max-age=31536000, immutable`

This means deleted files remain accessible for up to 1 year!

## ‚úÖ The Solution I Just Implemented

### 1. **Auto Cache Invalidation on Delete**
When you delete a file through your app, it now:
- ‚úÖ Deletes from S3
- ‚úÖ **Automatically invalidates CloudFront cache**
- ‚úÖ Video becomes unavailable immediately

### Updated Files:
- `src/app/api/delete-media/route.ts` - Now invalidates CloudFront cache
- `scripts/invalidate-cloudfront-cache.js` - Manual invalidation script

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### Automatic (Recommended):
Just delete posts normally through your app - cache invalidation happens automatically now.

### Manual Invalidation:
If you need to invalidate manually:

```bash
# Install dependency first
npm install @aws-sdk/client-cloudfront

# Run invalidation script
node scripts/invalidate-cloudfront-cache.js <distribution-id> <path>

# Example: Invalidate all video files
node scripts/invalidate-cloudfront-cache.js E1234567890ABC /content/videos/*

# Example: Invalidate everything
node scripts/invalidate-cloudfront-cache.js E1234567890ABC /*
```

### Environment Variable Required:
Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID=your-distribution-id-here
```

You can find your Distribution ID in AWS CloudFront console.

## üö® Important Notes

### CloudFront Invalidation:
- **Free tier:** 1,000 invalidations per month
- **Cost:** $0.005 per path after free tier
- **Time:** Takes 1-15 minutes to complete globally

### Better Alternatives:
1. **Use versioning** - Add `?v=timestamp` to URLs
2. **Reduce cache time** - Lower from 1 year to shorter periods
3. **Edge caching** - Use CloudFront Origin Shield

## üìä Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Delete a post** through your app
2. **Check S3 console** - file should be gone
3. **Wait 2-5 minutes** - for CloudFront invalidation
4. **Try to load video** - should get 404 error

---

## üîß Optional: Reduce Cache Time

If you want files to expire faster, update `cloudfront-config.json`:

```json
{
  "DefaultTTL": 86400,  // 1 day instead of 0
  "MaxTTL": 604800      // 1 week instead of 1 year
}
```

Then redeploy your CloudFront distribution.

---

## üìù Summary

**Before:** Deleted files stayed in CloudFront cache for up to 1 year
**After:** Deleted files are immediately invalidated from cache

**The fix is now live in your delete media API route!** üéâ
